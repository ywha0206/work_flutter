# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.

#linter란?
# 코드 스타일과 품질을 검사하여 코드에 있는 잠재적 오류
# 스타일 위반, 비효율적 패턴 등을 알려주는 도구입니다.
linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.

    # 상수로 선언 가능한 생성자에 대해 경고를 표시하지 않음으로 설정.

    prefer_const_declarations: false
    # 불변 컬렉션(List, Map, Set 등)에 대해 const를 사용하지 않아도 경고를 표시하지 않음.
    prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables: false
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
